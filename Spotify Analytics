# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle and created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# I then performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table. 

#First, I wanted to determine the top artists with a score of at least 90 by averaging the score of each artist's songs. 
#I then ordered from most to least popular.

SELECT artist_name, AVG(popularity) AS average_popularity 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name HAVING average_popularity >= 90
ORDER BY average_popularity DESC

#Afterwards, I utilized a CTE and added a column which would label the top aritsts as "Top Star"

WITH popularity_average_CTE AS (
SELECT s.artist_name,
AVG(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM SpotifyData s
GROUP BY s.artist_name
)

SELECT  artist_name,
        average_popularity,
        'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity >= 90
ORDER BY average_popularity DESC;

#Then, I wanted to find out how the average tempo of the top ten songs compared to the average tempo of all songs on the list.

#The following SQL was used to find the average tempo of the top ten songs.

SELECT ROUND(AVG(tempo))
AS average_tempo_of_top_ten
FROM SpotifyData 
WHERE popularity IN 
(SELECT popularity FROM SpotifyData ORDER BY popularity DESC LIMIT 10);

#Then the following SQL was used to find the average tempo of all songs on the list:

SELECT ROUND(AVG(tempo))
AS average_tempo_of_all
FROM SpotifyData 
WHERE popularity IN 
(SELECT popularity FROM SpotifyData ORDER BY popularity);

#Interestingly, the average tempo of the top ten was 15 BPM higher at 136 BPM compared to 121 BPM average of all the songs!
